"abstract":"<jats:p>In recent years, there has been a significant increase in attention to such a topic as e-Health, as well as one of its main areas - mobile e-health (mHealth). This is due to global trends, such as the increased attention of state institutions to the health of their citizens, the desire of people to maintain their health and improve the quality of life, digitalization and qualitative growth in the level of medical services, the development and dissemination of personal wearable electronic equipment and ICT technologies. The article discusses a typical architecture of a network for providing mHealth services, which includes a user's smart phone or tablet with specialized software, various mHealth devices, such as an analyzer of the composition of food and drugs or a wearable biometric sensor, as well as a remote cloud server for processing and long-term storage of user data, for connection to Internet is used. The article provides an overview of works on the mHealth topic. In particular, it is noted that at present, Russian and foreign scientists are actively studying the architecture of networks, the characteristics of the generated mHealth network traffic. Peculiarities of using mHealth mobile applications for collecting and analyzing primary data on the user's health are considered. Active research is underway on the performance of mHealth devices, such as portable personal infrared micro spectrometers, which are capable of highly efficient field analysis of food and drug composition. It is noted that such devices and related services may become quite popular in the very near future.<\/jats:p>",
